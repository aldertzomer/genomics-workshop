This course is a fork (copy) of the *Genomics Workshop* from [Data Carpentry](https://datacarpentry.org/) which is adjusted for the **Microbial Genomics course at Utrecht University**.
Data Carpentry‚Äôs aim is to teach researchers basic concepts, skills, and tools for working
with data so that they can get more done in less time, and with less pain. This workshop
teaches data management and analysis for genomics research including: 

- best practices for organization of bioinformatics projects and data, 
- use of command-line utilities, 
- use of command-line tools to analyze sequence quality and perform variant calling, 
- and connecting to and using cloud computing.  

  
## Getting Started

This lesson assumes that learners have no prior experience with the tools covered in the workshop.  
However, learners are expected to have some familiarity with biological concepts, including the concept of genomic variation within a population. Participants should bring their own laptops and plan to participate actively. 

## Data
 
This workshop uses data from a long term evolution experiment published in 2016: [Tempo and mode of genome evolution in a 50,000-generation experiment](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4988878/) by Tenaillon O, Barrick JE, Ribeck N, Deatherage DE, Blanchard JL, Dasgupta A, Wu GC, Wielgoss S, Cruveiller S, M√©digue C, Schneider D, and Lenski RE. (doi: 10.1038/nature18959)  
  
All of the data used in this workshop can be [downloaded from Figshare](https://figshare.com/articles/Data_Carpentry_Genomics_beta_2_0/7726454). However to make things more convenient and limit the time to download large files, all data is provided locally in your cocalc personal home directory as well.  
More information about this data is available on the [Data page](https://aldertzomer.github.io/organization-genomics/data/).

# Teaching Platform
This workshop is as original as possible from the [Data Carpentries workshop series](http://datacarpentry.org/) however it was partly redesigned to initially be run at the CoCalc platform hosted at Utrecht University, but **from edition 2024** onwards we moved back to a classical (full) command line interface at **[gemini.science.uu.nl](ssh://gemini.science.uu.nl)**!<br>
If you want to run your own instance of a similar server used for this workshop, follow the directions to generate an Amazon version as described on [DataCarpentry genomics](https://datacarpentry.org/genomics-workshop/AMI-setup) or alternatively try the *Windows Subsystem for Linux* (WSL Ubuntu) on MS windows.
